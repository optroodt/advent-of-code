# Advent of Code
These are my solutions (or attempts) for the yearly Advent of Code!

A lot of the code is _very_ dirty and not really suitable for publication, this is not how I write production code! ðŸ˜… I participate for the intellectual challenge, not for competition. Usually I stop after day 10 or so as the Christmas festivities increase.
